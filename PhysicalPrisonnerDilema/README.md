# Physical Prisoner's Dilemma
This code just runs the prisoner's dilemma using the robotarium to simulate it. Agents can either cooperate or not and evolve to eventually make the best decision. <br>
Can be run with and without tags by modifying train_v2.py <br>
To run, make sure your environment can support the Robotarium and run `python3 train_v2.py`
